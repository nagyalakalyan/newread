       <h3>Aljapur Srinivas Garu</h3>
       <p>I take great pleasure for being the chairman of this institution. I have a strong desire to uplift the standard of living of the people belonging to the rural area. Kshatriya College of Engineering (KCEA) has evolved out of that desire. With clear goal, KCEA is leaping forward to the next decade. We have overcome a lot of obvious hurdles which most of the rural engineering colleges in the state are still facing. I am proud to say that KCEA was successful in attracting and retaining the faculty from IIT background. Senior staff from reputed organizations such as DRDO are rendering their services to the institution. KCEA believes in holistic development of the student. Our country requires youth with sound technical skills, strong leadership skills and sensible towards human ethics. To ensure the creation of energetic youth, a lot of initiatives have been taken; a few of them were establishment of research & development cell in collaboration with Microsoft corporation, NCC & NSS units for boys and girls and the digital class rooms with modern infrastructure. We have an immediate challenge to achieve total quality management of the institution and total quality of individual i.e., both faculty and students. One of the ways to achieve total quality is through NBA accreditation. It will not be a difficult task for us to get NBA accreditation, as our institution is already an ISO 9001:2008 certified. However, with a little extra effort from all the stakeholders of the institution we can easily acquire the accreditation. Greater expectations and bigger goals are ahead of us. Enriched by our experience let us all embrace our responsibilities with enthusiasm, commitment and loyalty. Students are advised to be careful at all the times, adhere to safety norms and be focused on the academics. All the best.</p>

       <b> Faculty:</b> Our college has around 60–70 faculty with extremes in their subjects. Even though there were separate faculty for labs, games, subjects, and many other things.
